# OS simulator

This was a project for my Systems Programming Class.

# The Problem

I was tasked with taking a shell program and implementing basic OS functionality. This included a fully functional shell that could execute commands. I also implemented Piping and I/O redirection allowing multiple commands to be chained together. Finally, I wrote scheduling algorithms for LIFO, SJF, RR, and FCFS and added mutexes to avoid programs accessing the same resources.

# What I learned.

programming in C is hard. Learning to manage memory and pointers is pretty difficult. Everything else seems easy in comparison. Pretty interesting project though, I definitely learned a lot about how computers work. 

# How to Run on Linux

1. in terminal cd to the folder
2. run `make test` to test the scheduling programs
3. otherwise run `make`
4. run `./MyOS shell` to run the terminal simulator
